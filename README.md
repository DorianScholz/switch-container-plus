# Switch Container Plus

The Add-on and informations about it can be found on [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/switch-container-plus/).

## Fork

This is a fork of [Switch Container](https://gitlab.com/mjanetmars/switch-container) because the author denied a [Merge request](https://gitlab.com/mjanetmars/switch-container/merge_requests/2) introducing middle mouse clicks. Thanks to MarsCat for the main work on this Add-on. Everything is [contributed back upstream](https://gitlab.com/mjanetmars/switch-container/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all&author_username=stoically).
